# Google_Places_Reviews_API

A couple of simple functions working together to call the Google Places APIs (text search and details). The result is a processed set of reviews of a place. It was initially created to get Bars/Restaurants reviews but could be used for any place.

There is an assumption that the 1st google place id is the correct one which may not be the case depending on how specific or vague the initial text search query is. It seems to work well with a restaurant name and neighbourhood or part of the address
